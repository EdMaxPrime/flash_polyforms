Created a very simple template that renders all 4 question types. This will be presented to anyone who wants to respond to a form. It has no css styling, and doesn't support min and max limits on input.

zlotskiyM -- 2018-05-25 18:25
The Form Responses (spreadsheet) and My Forms (list of things user made) pages don't need hardcoded data anymore. They can display arbitrary information.

zlotskiyM -- 2018-05-25 20:32
Aesthetic changes to the Form Responses and My Forms pages, as well as the base template. Notably, the navbar collapses on small screens, and the spreadsheet toolbar splits into multiple lines.
